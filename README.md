# AirBnB_clone

## Description

- The AirBnB Clone is an ALX School project that is aimed at helping students apply concepts and skills learnt over time in the program.
- It aims to replicate the AirBnB app ultimately. It is going to be implemented in phases.
- On completion, it will be a web app composed by:
  - A command interpreter to manipulate data without a visual interface, like in a Shell (perfect for development and debugging)
  - A website (the front-end) that shows the final product to everybody: static and dynamic
  - A database or files that store data (data = objects)
  - An API that provides a communication interface between the front-end and your data (`retrieve`, `create`, `delete`, `update` them)
